# in your CLI
git clone https://github.com/cebe/yii2-openapi.git
cd yii2-openapi
make clean_all
make up
make installdocker
sudo chmod -R 777 tests/tmp/ # TODO avoid 777 https://github.com/cebe/yii2-openapi/issues/156
make migrate

# to check everything is setup up correctly ensure all tests passes
make cli
# in Docker container
./vendor/bin/phpunit

# create new branch from master and Happy contributing!
```

These commands are available to develop and check the tests. It is available inside the Docker container. To enter into bash shell of container, run `make cli` .

```bash
cd tests
./yii migrate-mysql/up
./yii migrate-mysql/down 4

./yii migrate-maria/up
./yii migrate-maria/down 4

./yii migrate-pgsql/up
./yii migrate-pgsql/down 4
```

To apply multiple migration with one command:

```bash
./yii migrate-mysql/up --interactive=0 && \
./yii migrate-mysql/down --interactive=0 4 && \
./yii migrate-maria/up --interactive=0 && \
./yii migrate-maria/down --interactive=0 4 && \
./yii migrate-pgsql/up --interactive=0 && \
./yii migrate-pgsql/down --interactive=0 4
```

PHPUnit run only one test by regex
----------------------------------

If a PHPUnit test file have 2 test method with names like `testEdit()` and `testEditExpression()` then by running `./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter XDbDefaultExpressionTest::testEdit` both tests will run. In order to run only one test `testEdit()`, run below command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter '/XDbDefaultExpressionTest::testEdit$/'
```


Switching PHP versions
----------------------

You can switch the PHP version of the docker runtime by changing the `PHP_VERSION` environment variable in the `.env` file.

If you have no `.env` file yet, create it by copying `.env.dist` to `.env`.

After changing the PHP Version you need to run `make down up` to start the new container with new version.

Example:

```
$ echo "PHP_VERSION=7.4" > .env
$ make down up cli

## Use PR of your own fork of this library in your project to check new changes

Say you have a fork of this library at https://github.com/SOHELAHMED7/yii2-openapi

You implemented new changes or fixed bugs and created PR on GitHub. It is not yet merged in upstream master branch.

You wanted to check this new changes in your own project which is using this lib cebe/yii2-openapi.

You can accomplish it by:


Add below to composer.json of your project file


```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://asset-packagist.org"
        },
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "http://github.com/SOHELAHMED7/yii2-openapi"
        }
    ]
```

Then lets say you have PR https://github.com/SOHELAHMED7/yii2-openapi/pull/24.

And branch name is `143-if-data-type-is-not-changed-then-still-migrations-are-generated-for-timestamp-in-mysql`.

Run below command:

```bash
composer require cebe/yii2-openapi:dev-143-if-data-type-is-not-changed-then-still-migrations-are-generated-for-timestamp-in-mysql
```

Ensure to use upstream package name `cebe/yii2-openapi` instead of your fork (`sohelahmed7/yii2-openapi`) in composer command. And prefix branch name by `dev-`
